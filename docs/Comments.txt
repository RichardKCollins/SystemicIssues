@TracyDimond  I am just quoting the video.  When I see good things I try to set them out so others can see them clearly.  In the video it goes by in an instant, but as text we can read it again and again and think about it. I have been thinking about all the herbs, spices, and foods that humans eat.  Many things are indigestible even poison before they are prepared and cooked.  I work on things like "feed all humans a nutritious diet" and work out how that can be done safely and fairly for all humans and related species.
