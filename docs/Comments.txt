@TracyDimond  I am just quoting the video.  When I see good things I try to set them out so others can see them clearly.  In the video it goes by in an instant, but as text we can read it again and again and think about it. I have been thinking about all the herbs, spices, and foods that humans eat.  Many things are indigestible even poison before they are prepared and cooked.  I work on things like "feed all humans a nutritious diet" and work out how that can be done safely and fairly for all humans and related species.

With that many students and faculty, and all the ones writing papers, Stanford can hardly miss such a broad target as "AI advances".  

It is interesting Zara mentions Harvard (1636, $53.2 Billion endowment) and Stanford (1885, 9400 undergraduate, 21000 graduate), One would think there are only a dozen schools in the world from the media frenzy.  

When the topic is hot, strike. Whether it is AI, CS, students grumbling or academics fighting. Controversy sells, boasting sells.  The quiet work of 100s of Millions just gets done and no one notices.  I think there  are about 25,000 colleges and universities in the world and they only focus on about 15,000 topics with a long tail.

Most any class anywhere (any time) will know that their professors are out of date on many things. It is simply not possible to educate billions of people in the world now using only paper and blackboards, talking heads, human memorization,  and too slow curation and processing of the world's knowledge into usable tools for everyone.
